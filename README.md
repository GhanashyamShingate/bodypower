Ghanashyam Shingate- I worked on developing feedback.html and about.html pages. For feedback.html, I created form with different inputs from the visitor. I created form container and form attributes. In about.html page, I created page using sections to include information about the website. Also used blockquote for by default margin.

Sameer Shaligram- I worked on developing index.html and services.html pages. I created home.index page and included image, footer, section, meta and blockquote tags. I created services.html page to show the services provided by fitness centre. In both pages, I created transitions for images. 

Amit Miskeen- I worked on creating contact us page. I created a form using different tags so that it looks good. Also I created a page named computebmi.html which will be opened when you click on 'computebmi' button on home page.

Design Principles-

Proximity
  
      We have used one image along with a paragraph and vice versa for the many pages which looks modern page layout.
      We have used colors that are of opposite contrasts but mainly light colors with dark images.
      We have also used different fonts for the pages.
      
Contrast and Typography 
  
      For contact us page, form container and sleek material design format is used learned in the lab test.
      We have used various input tags such as text, radio button, message type and option.

Responsive Design

     We have used mobile first approach for smaller size at min width 769px and min width 1025px. Proximity of 61.8 and 34 % (golden ratio) is also used.
      
Accessibility Compliance
  
    All the images have alt tag for better accessibility. All html tags are properly nested with each other.
    
Search Engine Optimization Strategy
  
    We have used Keywords and content with meta tag for SEO Strategy.
  
    We have used meta keywords such as gym, health and fitness, gym fitness, gym near me, treadmill, body building, exercise, workout, workout centre near me, cardio, personal trainer, exercise bike, aerobic, fitness studio, abs workout, lifetime fitness, gym equipment, gym trainer, personal fitness, aerobic exercise, world gym, crunches, healthy diet, healthy routine, exercise routine, gym routine, gym time, fitness freak, yoga, yoga classes, yoga fitness, diet plan, eggs diet plan, vegetables diet plan.
    
    Also, we have used meta description, "We are gym website located in London Ontario. We provide all kind of gym training exercise at our centre, teach yoga as well and provide diet plans according to experts."
