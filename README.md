Design Principles

Proximity
  
      I have used one image along with a paragraph and vice versa for the main page which looks modern page layout.
      I have used colors that are of opposite contrasts but mainly light colors with dark images.
      I have also used google fonts for the pages.
      
Contrast and Typography 
  
      For contact us page, I have used form container and sleek material design format that I have learned in the lab test.
      I have used various input tags such as text, radio button, message type and option.

Responsive Design

     I have used mobile first approach for smaller size at min width 900px. Proximity of 61.8 and 34 % which is called golden ratio.
      
Accessibility Compliance
  
    All the images have alt tag for better accessibility. 
    
Search Engine Optimization Strategy
  
    I have used Keywords and content with meta tag for SEO Strategy.
  
    I have used meta keywords such as gym, health and fitness, gym fitness, gym near me, treadmill, body building, exercise, workout, workout centre near me, cardio, personal trainer, exercise bike, aerobic, fitness studio, abs workout, lifetime fitness, gym equipment, gym trainer, personal fitness, aerobic exercise, world gym, crunches, healthy diet, healthy routine, exercise routine, gym routine, gym time, fitness freak, yoga, yoga classes, yoga fitness, diet plan, eggs diet plan, vegetables diet plan.
    
    Also, I have used meta description, "We are gym website located in London Ontario. We provide all kind of gym training exercise at our centre, teach yoga as well and provide diet plans according to experts."
