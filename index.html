          <h3>Coaches</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              All of our coaches at BPG have been through a rigorous screening
              process and have met our high standards for coaching. Their
              coaching experience combined with their practical application of
              BPG in competition or in training for GPP (general physical
              preparedness) gives all our coaches hundreds to thousands of hours
              of experience.

          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              We do all our work with barbells, kettlebells, boxes, wall balls,
              gymnastics rings and a pull-up rig. We have zero mirrors on the
              floor, no gym gossip, and no salesmen. If you want results and you
              want to be fit, strong, and healthy, we provide a fun environment
              that fosters all of the above. Before and after workout we
              encourage and foster community building in our gym lounge and
              mobility room. Classes are one hour long and the workout of the
              day is the same for the entire day. So if you miss your regular
              class time, you can come in later in the day and get the same
              workout in. You will get warmed up, work on a particular skill or
              strength movement, do the workout, stretch out, all in a one hour
              class.

            <p>
              BPG is a great platform for building a strong and tight-knit
              community around something positive. We will have a very intimate
              membership base and you will get to know each member and at one
              time or another you will get to workout with everyone. As CrossFit
              Deliverance becomes a part of your daily routine, you will forge
              amazing friendships and be held accountable by not only your
              coaches, but your fellow members that you see day in and day out.
              The University District already has an amazing sense of community
              and we want to add to it and continue to build up this already
              great community.
